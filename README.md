## 🚀 Overview

This repository contains the top 5 real-time AI/ML projects I developed during my internship. These projects focus on solving real-world problems using advanced tools like **Google Gemini**, **LangChain**, **FAISS**, **Streamlit**, and more.

Each project is placed in a dedicated folder with code, dependencies, and instructions.
